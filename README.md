Creating a Product Search Engine using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

For this application, it contains a list of clothing items whereby the user can scroll and look through. There is also a search bar included so that the user can search for a specific item and whilst that is being done the application will only display the items that contain the keyword inside the search bar and filter out the unnecessary clothing items.
